Take in a letter from the user as a ``char``, and display its integer equivalent.
Then display the uppercase version of the letter and its integer equivalent.

Example:

> Enter a character: **c**<br>
> 'c' in decimal is 99.<br>

Exercise 2

Take in a 5-letter word from the user.</br>
Then, convert the word to the proper capitalization (first letter is capitalized, and the rest lowercase).

Example:

> Enter a 5-letter word: **hElLo**<br>
> Your word is Hello.


Exercise 3
---

Create a program which will guess what number the user is thinking of (between 1 and 5) in as few guesses as possible.

Example:

> Is your number greater than, less than, or equal to 3?<br>
> **greater**<br>
> Is your number less than, or equal to 5?<br>
> **equal**<br>
> I got it! Your number is 5!


Exercise 4
---

Take in a number from the user (between -50 and 50) then output between which multiples of 10 the number is between and whether it is positive or negative.
If the number is 0, simply output that the number was 0. 
If the number is a multiple of 10, output that the number was a positive/negative multiple of 10. 

Example 1:

> Enter a number: **-37**<br>
> Your number is negative and between -30 and -40

Example 2:

> Enter a number: **40**<br>
> Your number is a positive multiple of 10

Example 3:

> Enter a number: **0**<br>
> Your number is 0


<!-- this exercise SUCKS. Make a better one, or none at all.

Exercise 5 
---
Take in how much money (integer) the user has.</br>
Then take in 4 items from the user.</br>
Each item should have a name (string), cost (integer), and appeal (integer).</br>
Then output which item the user should buy with appeal being of highest priority followed by lowest cost.</br>
Do not reccomend the user to buy an item they cannot afford.

Example:

> Enter how much money you have: **3**<br>
> Enter the name, cost, and appeal of your first item: **Doritoes 3 3**<br>
> Enter the name, cost, and appeal of your second item: **Lays 1 2**<br>
> Enter the name, cost, and appeal of your third item: **Cheetos 3 4**<br>
> Enter the name, cost, and appeal of your fourth item: **Pringles 4 5**<br>
> You should buy the Cheetos
