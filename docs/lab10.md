# Instructions

Take out a piece of paper and a pencil/pen. 

Once you're instructed to begin, go to the following link:
[Mock Final](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1btoS3CokpMmFq68v_CnIqUx7BpF4irOvdC5xx1fimCs/edit?usp=sharing)

Once everyone has finished, we will go over the answers as a class.

A link will be added to this website with a key to this mock final later in the week.
