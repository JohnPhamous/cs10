An 
<a style="color:white;border:solid black;border-width:1px">array/vector</a>
is a special variable having one name, but storing a list of data items, with each item directly accessible.

Each item in an array/vector is known as an 
<a style="color:white;border:solid black;border-width:1px">element</a>
.

In an array/vector, each element's location number is called the 
<a style="color:white;border:solid black;border-width:1px">index</a>
.

<a style="color:white;border:solid black;border-width:1px">Arrays</a>
are native to c++ while
<a style="color:white;border:solid black;border-width:1px">vectors</a>
are not.

<a style="color:white;border:solid black;border-width:1px">vctr.push_back(value)</a>
creates a new element at the end of vector and assigns the given value to that element.

A vector's size can be set or changed while a program is executing using 
<a style="color:white;border:solid black;border-width:1px">vctr.resize(N)</a>
.

<a style="color:white;border:solid black;border-width:1px">Vectors</a>
are safer because the access b.at(i) is checked during execution to ensure the index is within the range. 
<a style="color:white;border:solid black;border-width:1px">Array's</a>
access b\[i\] involves no such check. 

<a style="color:white;border:solid black;border-width:1px">Vectors</a>
have more advantages than 
<a style="color:white;border:solid black;border-width:1px">arrays,</a>
like resizing during runtime, easy insertion of items at the front or rear, determining vector size, etc.
