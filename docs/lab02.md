Exercise 1
---

Ask the user for 2 numbers, then divide them and show the result.

Example:

> Enter the dividend: **4**<br>
> Enter the divisor: **2**<br>
> 4 / 2 == 2


Exercise 2
---

Get a character from the user, and display its integer equivalent.
The keyword for the character datatype is ``char``.

Example:

> Enter a character: **c**<br>
> 'c' in decimal is 99.

Exercise 3
---

Get a 5-letter word from the user.
Then, convert it to the proper capitalization (first letter is capitalized, and the rest are lowercase).

Example:

> Enter a 5-letter word: **hElLo**<br>
> Your word is Hello.


Exercise 4
---

Write a program to perform modulus between two floating-point values.
The modulus operator `%` will not work on doubles.
Do not use `fmod` from the cmath library (although you can use it to verify your results).
Do not worry about negative values.


Here is a hint:

> For two positive integers N (numerator) and D (denominator),<br>
> N can be expressed as D\*m + R.<br>
> m is some integer multiple of D.<br>
> R is the remainder of the division between N and D.<br>
> R = N - D*m<br>
> R and m are unknowns in this equation.<br>
> Find m to solve for R.

Examples:

> Enter the dividend: **23.4**<br>
> Enter the divisor: **3.2**<br>
> 23.4 % 3.2 == 1

> Enter the dividend: **54.7**<br>
> Enter the divisor: **3.14**<br>
> 54.7 % 3.14 == 1.32


Exercise 5 (advanced)
---

Use modulus and division to print the binary value of a character.

Example:

> Enter a character: **c**<br>
> 'c' in binary is 01100011.

Hint: once you have the decimal value of a character [part 3],
you can google something like "<a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=99+in+binary" target="_blank">99 in binary</a>"
to double-check your results.
Also, characters all have 8 bits.




<!-- future idea: give them some poorly-formatted code and have them format it properly.
     It could do anything, because they don't need to understand it to format it. -->
