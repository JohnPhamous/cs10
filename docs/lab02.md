Exercise 1
---

Write a short program that asks the user for 2 numbers, then divides them and shows the result.


Exercise 2
---

Using a combination of math, ``double``, ``int``, and/or type casting, write a program that performs floating point modulus.

Here's a hint:

<pre>
For two positive integers P and Q where P >= Q,

P can be expressed as Q*D + R

D is some divisor of Q
R is the remainder (and is always less than Q)
</pre>

Don't worry about negative floating point values.
