Exercise 1
---

Ask the user for 2 numbers, then divide them and show the result.

Example:

> Enter the dividend: **4**<br>
> Enter the divisor: **2**<br>
> 4 / 2 == 2


Exercise 2
---

Using a combination of math, the datatypes ``double`` and ``int``, and/or type casting, write a program that performs floating point modulus.

Here's a hint:

> For two positive integers P and Q where P >= Q,<br>
> P can be expressed as Q\*D + R<br>
> D is some divisor of Q<br>
> R is the remainder (and is always less than Q)

Don't worry about negative floating point values.

Examples:

> Enter the dividend: **23.4**<br>
> Enter the divisor: **3.2**<br>
> 23.4 % 3.2 == 1

> Enter the dividend: **54.7**<br>
> Enter the divisor: **3.14**<br>
> 54.7 % 3.14 == 1.32


Exercise 3
---

Get a character from the user, and display its integer equivalent.
The keyword for the character datatype is ``char``.

Example:

> Enter a character: **c**<br>
> 'c' in decimal is 99.


Exercise 4
---

Get a 5-letter word from the user.
Then, convert it to the proper capitalization (first letter is capitalized, and the rest are lowercase).

Example:

> Enter a 5-letter word: **hElLo**<br>
> Your word is Hello.


Exercise 5 (advanced)
---

Use modulus and division to print the binary value of a character.

Example:

> Enter a character: **c**<br>
> 'c' in binary is 01100011.

Hint: once you have the decimal value of a character [part 3],
you can google something like "<a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=99+in+binary" target="_blank">99 in binary</a>"
to double-check your results.
Also, characters all have 8 bits.




<!-- future idea: give them some poorly-formatted code and have them format it properly.
     It could do anything, because they don't need to understand it to format it. -->
